# Archive - Development Documentation

This folder contains internal development documentation, testing logs, and migration guides that were used during the project's creation with Claude Code.

## Why These Are Archived

These files documented the **development process** with Claude Code, including:
- Internal testing procedures
- Migration steps during development
- Troubleshooting guides for development issues
- Automated audit reports

**Users don't need these** - they just need:
- `README.md` - Main documentation
- `README-CODESPACES.md` - Codespaces quick start
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - How to contribute

## Historical Context

This project was built iteratively with Claude Code in October 2025:
1. Started with basic FRR labs
2. Added SSH access with multiple credential iterations
3. Migrated from docker-outside-of-docker to docker-in-docker
4. Implemented automated Codespaces deployment
5. Added comprehensive testing and documentation

These archived files tell that story but aren't needed for using the labs.

**For Users**: You can safely ignore this `.archive/` folder - it's not part of the lab experience!
