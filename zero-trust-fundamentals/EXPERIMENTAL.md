# üß™ EXPERIMENTAL: Zero Trust Security Lab Series

**Status:** Early Development ‚Ä¢ Proof of Concept ‚Ä¢ Community Feedback Requested

## Vision

Build the **most comprehensive, hands-on Zero Trust security education** available for free. Not just theory‚Äîreal microservices, real authentication, real security patterns you can deploy and break.

## Current Status: Lab 1 POC (v0.1)

This is a **minimal viable demonstration** of Zero Trust fundamentals:
- ‚úÖ JWT-based authentication (FastAPI)
- ‚úÖ Token validation on every request
- ‚úÖ Short-lived credentials (5-minute expiry)
- ‚úÖ MongoDB session management
- ‚úÖ Working demo script

**What's NOT here yet:**
- SIEM integration
- Comprehensive test suite
- VyOS firewall integration (configured, not tested)
- Advanced scenarios (device health, risk scoring)
- Production-grade security patterns

## Our Goals

### Goal 1: Educational Excellence
**Make Zero Trust accessible** to network engineers, security teams, and developers through practical, hands-on labs.

**Why this matters:**
- Most Zero Trust content is vendor marketing or pure theory
- Engineers need hands-on practice before production
- Free education builds better security practitioners

### Goal 2: Complete Lab Series (6 Labs - ALL FREE)

| Lab | Status | Key Concepts |
|-----|--------|--------------|
| **1. Fundamentals** | üß™ POC | Verify explicitly, Least privilege, Assume breach |
| **2. Lateral Movement** | üìã Planned | Micro-segmentation, East-West security |
| **3. Device Compliance** | üìã Planned | Device trust, Risk-based access |
| **4. Anomaly Detection** | üìã Planned | Behavioral analytics, Auto-response |
| **5. JIT Access** | üìã Planned | Time-limited tokens, RBAC/ABAC |
| **6. Encryption/mTLS** | üìã Planned | Encrypt everything, Certificate auth |

### Goal 3: Real-World Simulation
**Not just containers running‚Äîactual security scenarios:**
- Simulated breaches (web tier compromised)
- Attack detection (data exfiltration attempts)
- Automated response (token revocation, IP blocking)
- Compliance logging (HIPAA, SOC 2, PCI-DSS patterns)

### Goal 4: Technology Stack Diversity
**Learn transferable skills:**
- FastAPI microservices (modern Python)
- MongoDB (NoSQL patterns)
- VyOS firewalls (network-level zero trust)
- JWT authentication (industry standard)
- Docker/containerlab (cloud-native deployment)

### Goal 5: Community-Driven Development
**We need YOUR feedback:**
- What zero trust concepts are confusing?
- What attack scenarios should we simulate?
- What real-world problems are you trying to solve?
- What tools/platforms should we integrate?

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current - Month 1)
- [x] Lab 1 POC - Zero Trust Fundamentals

### Phase 2: Core Labs (Month 2-3)
- [ ] Lab 2: Lateral Movement Prevention
- [ ] Lab 3: Device Compliance & Risk Scoring
- [ ] SIEM integration across all labs
- [ ] Automated attack simulations

### Phase 3: Advanced Topics (Month 4-5)
- [ ] Lab 4: Anomaly Detection & Auto-Response
- [ ] Lab 5: Just-In-Time Access
- [ ] Lab 6: Encryption & mTLS
- [ ] Integration examples (Okta, Auth0, Datadog)

### Phase 4: Production Patterns (Month 6+)
- [ ] Kubernetes deployments
- [ ] Cloud provider integration (AWS/Azure/GCP)
- [ ] Service mesh examples (Istio, Linkerd)
- [ ] Enterprise scenarios (multi-region, HA)

## How You Can Help

### Try the POC
```bash
cd zero-trust-fundamentals
docker-compose up -d
./scripts/demo.sh
```

**Tell us:**
- Did it work on your system?
- Was the README clear?
- What confused you?
- What would you want to learn next?

### Share Your Use Case
**What are you trying to secure?**
- Internal microservices?
- Cloud applications?
- IoT devices?
- Legacy systems?

We'll build labs that address real problems.

### Suggest Features
**Open a GitHub issue:**
- "Add multi-factor authentication"
- "Show OAuth2 integration"
- "Demonstrate credential rotation"
- "Add rate limiting examples"

### Contribute Code
**All contributions welcome:**
- Bug fixes
- Documentation improvements
- New test scenarios
- Additional services (e.g., LDAP, SAML)

## Why We're Building This

**Traditional security training is broken:**
- ‚ùå Expensive vendor courses ($2000-5000)
- ‚ùå Theory-heavy, little hands-on practice
- ‚ùå Vendor lock-in (only learn Tool X)
- ‚ùå No attack/defense scenarios

**Our approach:**
- ‚úÖ Completely FREE and open source
- ‚úÖ Hands-on labs you can deploy in 5 minutes
- ‚úÖ Vendor-neutral (learn concepts, not products)
- ‚úÖ Red team + blue team perspectives
- ‚úÖ Real code you can study and modify

## Technology Choices

**Why FastAPI?**
- Modern, fast, Python-based
- Industry-standard for microservices
- Easy to understand and modify
- Great documentation

**Why MongoDB?**
- Document model fits security events
- Fast for session management
- Easy to query audit logs
- No schema migrations

**Why VyOS?**
- Open source network OS
- Real firewall capabilities
- Containerlab compatible
- Production-grade features

**Why Docker Compose?**
- Simple local deployment
- No Kubernetes complexity (yet)
- Easy to understand architecture
- Quick iteration

## Success Metrics

**We'll know we succeeded when:**
- 1000+ GitHub stars (community validation)
- 100+ engineers complete all 6 labs
- 10+ companies use for team training
- Zero Trust concepts become accessible to everyone

## Questions We're Exploring

**Technical:**
- How short should token expiry be? (currently 5 min)
- Should we use refresh tokens?
- How to simulate realistic attack patterns?
- Best way to visualize security events?

**Educational:**
- What prerequisite knowledge do students need?
- How long should each lab take? (30min? 2hrs?)
- Should we provide video walkthroughs?
- How to make complex concepts approachable?

**Practical:**
- How to keep labs working as dependencies update?
- Should we provide hosted demos?
- How to handle security best practices vs simplicity?
- When to introduce production patterns?
