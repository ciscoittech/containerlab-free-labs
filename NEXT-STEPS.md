## Phase 2: Fix Issues (If Any)

### Common Issues to Watch For

**Containerlab deployment fails**:
- Check Docker daemon running
- Check privileged mode in devcontainer
- Verify network=host setting

**FRR containers not starting**:
- Check daemons file permissions
- Verify frr.conf syntax
- Check bind mount paths

**Validation tests failing**:
- Wait 30-60 seconds for protocols to converge
- Check neighbor adjacencies manually
- Verify IP addresses configured correctly

**Devcontainer not building**:
- Check Docker Desktop running
- Verify internet connection (pulls image)
- Check devcontainer.json syntax

### Fix Process
1. Identify issue
2. Update configs/scripts as needed
3. Re-test in devcontainer
4. Update documentation if needed
5. Git commit changes

---

## Phase 3: Finalize for Launch

### Update Main README
- [ ] Add badges (optional):
  - License badge
  - GitHub stars (after publish)
  - Lab count badge
- [ ] Add screenshot/topology diagram (optional)
- [ ] Verify all links work
- [ ] Check markdown formatting

### Create CONTRIBUTING.md (Optional)
```markdown
# Contributing

Thanks for your interest! To contribute:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch
3. Test your changes in devcontainer
4. Ensure validation tests pass
5. Submit a Pull Request
```

### Create .github/workflows/validate.yml (Optional CI)
```yaml
name: Validate Labs
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install containerlab
        run: bash -c "$(curl -sL https://get.containerlab.dev)"
      - name: Test OSPF Lab
        run: cd ospf-basics && ./scripts/deploy.sh && ./scripts/validate.sh
```

## Phase 5: Marketing & Promotion

### Reddit Posts

**r/networking**:
```
Title: [Open Source] Free Containerized Network Labs - OSPF, BGP, Linux Namespaces

Body:
I've created 3 free containerized network labs using Containerlab and FRR:

1. OSPF Basics - 3-router topology, single area
2. BGP eBGP Basics - 4 routers, 3 AS design
3. Linux Network Namespaces - Understanding container networking

Each lab includes:
- VS Code devcontainer support (one-click setup)
- Automated validation tests
- Comprehensive documentation
- 45-60 minute hands-on exercises

Why containerlab?
- 75% less memory than GNS3/EVE-NG
- 96% faster startup (30 sec vs 10+ min)
- No VMs needed, just Docker
