Title: [Open Source] Free Containerized Network Labs - OSPF, BGP, Linux Namespaces

Hey r/networking! I've been frustrated with how resource-heavy GNS3/EVE-NG labs are, so I built 3 free containerized network labs using Containerlab and FRR.

**What's Different:**
- 75% less memory (~50MB per router vs 1GB+ VMs)
- 96% faster startup (30 seconds vs 10+ minutes)
- One-click VS Code devcontainer setup
- Automated validation tests (17 tests total)

**Labs Included:**
1. OSPF Basics - 3 routers, Area 0, DR/BDR election
2. BGP eBGP Basics - 4 routers, 3 AS topology
3. Linux Network Namespaces - Container networking fundamentals

Each lab has comprehensive documentation, automated testing, and GitHub Actions CI.

**GitHub**: https://github.com/ciscoittech/containerlab-free-labs

I'm planning to build more advanced labs (MPLS, EVPN, SR Linux automation) and curious if there's interest in a hosted version (instant browser access, no local setup). Feedback welcome!

Tech stack: Containerlab, FRR (Cisco-like syntax), Docker, VS Code devcontainers
```

**r/ccna Post** (Day 2):
```markdown
Title: Free OSPF & BGP Labs Using Containers (No VMs Needed!)

Studying for CCNA/CCNP and tired of slow GNS3 labs? I built 3 free containerized labs:

‚úÖ OSPF single-area (3 routers, 45 min)
‚úÖ BGP eBGP basics (4 routers, 3 AS, 60 min)
‚úÖ Linux networking fundamentals (30 min)

**Why containers vs VMs?**
- Start in 30 seconds (not 10+ minutes)
- Uses ~50MB per router (not 1GB+)
- FRR has Cisco-like syntax
- Works on any machine with Docker

**One-click setup**: Open in VS Code ‚Üí Click "Reopen in Container" ‚Üí Done

GitHub: https://github.com/ciscoittech/containerlab-free-labs

Perfect for CCNA lab practice without expensive hardware or beefy VM setups. Each lab has automated tests so you know if you configured it correctly.
```

**r/devops Post** (Day 3):
```markdown
Title: Lightweight Network Labs Using Docker (OSPF, BGP) - Great for DevOps Engineers

For DevOps folks who need to understand network fundamentals but don't want to deal with GNS3/EVE-NG:

I built 3 containerized network labs using Containerlab:
- OSPF routing fundamentals
- BGP external peering
- Linux network namespaces (how containers work)

**DevOps-friendly features:**
- Docker-based (no VMs)
- VS Code devcontainers (one-click setup)
- Automated validation (bash scripts)
- GitHub Actions CI
- Infrastructure-as-code approach

GitHub: https://github.com/ciscoittech/containerlab-free-labs

Great for understanding how Kubernetes CNI plugins work, cloud VPC routing, or just leveling up network knowledge for multi-cloud architectures.
```

**Posting Schedule**:
- **Day 1 (Monday)**: r/networking (best engagement Mon-Wed)
- **Day 2 (Tuesday)**: r/ccna
- **Day 3 (Wednesday)**: r/devops
- **Day 4 (Thursday)**: r/networkautomation
- **Day 5 (Friday)**: r/homelab

### Channel 2: LinkedIn (Professional Network)

**LinkedIn Post** (Week 1):
```markdown
üöÄ Just launched: Free containerized network labs for learning OSPF, BGP, and Linux networking

After months of work, I'm excited to share 3 production-quality network labs built with Containerlab and FRR:

‚úÖ OSPF Basics - Single area, DR/BDR election, 6 automated tests
‚úÖ BGP eBGP Basics - Multi-AS topology, route propagation, 6 automated tests
‚úÖ Linux Network Namespaces - Foundation of container networking, 5 automated tests

**Why containerized labs?**
Traditional GNS3/EVE-NG setups require:
‚Ä¢ 1GB+ RAM per router
‚Ä¢ 10+ minutes to boot
‚Ä¢ Complex VM management

These containerized labs use:
‚Ä¢ ~50MB RAM per router (75% reduction!)
‚Ä¢ 30 second startup (96% faster!)
‚Ä¢ One-click VS Code devcontainer setup

**Perfect for:**
- Network engineers learning automation
- CCNA/CCNP students needing affordable labs
- DevOps engineers understanding network fundamentals
- Anyone wanting hands-on practice without heavy VMs

üîó GitHub: https://github.com/ciscoittech/containerlab-free-labs

**Tweet 3** (Day 3 - Show and tell):
```
Here's what deploying an OSPF lab looks like with containers:

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh
# 30 seconds later...
./scripts/validate.sh
# ‚úì All 6 tests passed!
```

No VMs. No heavy setup. Just Docker.

### Channel 4: Hacker News (Show HN)

**Hacker News Post** (Week 2):
```
Title: Show HN: Free containerized network labs (OSPF, BGP, Namespaces)

URL: https://github.com/ciscoittech/containerlab-free-labs

Comment (optional first comment):
I built these labs because I was frustrated with how resource-heavy traditional network lab tools (GNS3, EVE-NG) are.

These containerized labs use FRR (Free Range Routing) which gives you Cisco-like syntax without needing actual Cisco images or beefy VMs. Each router uses ~50MB of RAM instead of 1GB+, and everything starts in 30 seconds.

I focused on making them easy to use:
- VS Code devcontainers (one-click setup)
- Automated validation tests
- GitHub Actions CI
- Comprehensive documentation

Perfect for anyone learning OSPF, BGP, or just wanting to understand how container networking works under the hood.

Happy to answer questions!
```
